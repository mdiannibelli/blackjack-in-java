BlackJack made with Java
==========
This is my final installment for the first year of subject "Introduce to Programming" so I couldn't use POO.


# About the game
---
Blackjack is a card game where you must score 21 points throught the sum of value cards. You have to play against the Crupier who is going to be the computer.
You cannot exceed 21 and if in the first round your cards add up to 21 you will get a Blackjack, so you won. 

When you start the game will ask your name and give you $1000 USD free to play Blackjack. Then you have to enter the amount  you're going to bet and you're already starting to play.
A new deck of cards will be created in each game.

First, you will get 2 random deck cards and then it will check if you have Blackjack and if not, it will generate 1 random card for Crupier. 
Continuing you have two options "HIT" (request a card) and "STAND" (stand with the amount of your two cards valued before). If you click "STAND" two new random cards will be generated for Crupier until your cards add up to 17. 
Finally it compares the values of the Crupier's cards and the values of the User's cards and the higher values win.
